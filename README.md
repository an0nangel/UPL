Universal Pseudo Language.


## Why?
***Confusion***! There are hundereds of languages out in the world, and there doesn't exist a "*perfect language*"!  
So we decided it was a good idea to unify features from all languages in order to craft the near-perfect **pseudo-language**!  
Also  there is more to this, imagine a world where all developers will understand each-other, but not limited to developers only, since it's a pseudo lang it can
be understood by a wide range of people!  
You may think that this is very limiting and non-creative, but remember that this is only a pseudo lang, so of course that you can add your flavour and spin to it!  


## How?
Well i havent figured it out yet, but soon the syntax will be complete!
